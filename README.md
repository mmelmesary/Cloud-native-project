 # DevOps Project 

- **Our project is a cloud-native microservices-based application that is designed to run on Amazon Web Services (AWS) using Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS). We use Terraform to manage our infrastructure as code, Istio to provide advanced traffic management and security features for our microservices, Prometheus and Grafana to monitor our distributed systems, and ArgoCD to manage our continuous delivery pipelines. By using these cloud-native technologies, we can take full advantage of the scalability, resilience, and elasticity of the cloud.**
______

## Use Terraform to provision an EKS cluster

The [`terraform`](./Terraform) directory contains instructions for using [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/intro) 

## Use Prometheus for monitoring and grafana for virtualiztion

The [`Monitoring`](./Monitoring) directory contains instructions for using prometheus and grafana

## Use ArgoCD for GitOps automation 

The [`ArgoCD`](./ArgoCD) directory contains instructions for using ArgoCD



This repository contains code for my DevOps project, which utilizes multiple tools to achieve a variety of tasks. To learn more about each tool and how it contributes to the project, please see the README file in each directory:

- [Terraform](./Terraform/README.md)
- [ArgoCD](./ArgoCD/README.md)
- [Monitoring](./Monitoring/README.md)
- [Notifications](./Monitoring/notifications/README.md)
